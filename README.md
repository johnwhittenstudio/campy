## Creating API Keys <a id="api"></a>

This website requires 4 separate API keys:

- LocationIQ [LocationIQ-API](https://locationiq.com/)
- OpenWeather [OpenWeather-API](https://openweathermap.org/api)
- TheMealDB [TheMealDB-API](https://www.themealdb.com/)
- TheCocktailDB [TheCocktailDB-API](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/)

_The following 2 API keys will need to be created and set up by the user:_

- LocationIQ [LocationIQ-API](https://locationiq.com/)
- OpenWeather [OpenWeather-API](https://openweathermap.org/api)
  _See Instructions below._

_The following 2 API keys are open source with unlimited usage, do not need to be created by the user, and are hard-coded in the application:_

- TheMealDB [TheMealDB-API](https://www.themealdb.com/)
- TheCocktailDB [TheCocktailDB-API](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/)

### Creating a Location IQ API Key

LocationIQ [LocationIQ-API](https://locationiq.com/)

_You will need to make an account and get an API key. The Free Trial version of LocationIQ permits the user 1 Access Token with 5,000 requests /day and 2 requests /second._

- Visit the [LocationIQ-API](https://locationiq.com/) site. In the top right of the home page, click `SIGN UP`.

- Click `Sign in with Google` if you want to sign in with your Google account. OR enter your `Work email`, `Full name`, `Use Case`, and check the `I'm not a robot` reCAPTCHA box. Then click the `SIGN UP` button.

- The next page will require you to select an option from the `I'm using LocationIQ for:`, and you should select `A Website`. For the `I'll use the following APIs` checkbox options, check `All of them!`. Click `GET STARTED`.

- Click on the `API Access Tokens` on the left column to generate your personal API key.

- At this point, you'll be able to access a dashboard that includes your API key as well as your remaining API calls for the month.

### Creating an OpenWeather API Key

OpenWeather [OpenWeather-API](https://openweathermap.org/api)

_You will need to make an account and get an API key. The Free Trial version of LocationIQ permits the user with 60 calls /minute and 1,000,000 calls/month._

- Visit the [OpenWeather-API](https://openweathermap.org/api) site. Click `SIGN UP`.

- In the _**Create New Account**_ menu, enter your `Username`, `Email`, `Password`, and `Repeat Password`. Check the boxes next to `I am 16 years old and over` and `I agree with Privacy Policy, Terms and conditions...`. Consent to receive communications if you prefer. Check the `I'm not a robot` reCAPTCHA box. Then click the `Create Account` button.

- Once you are signed in, click on the `API keys` tab in your account. You can use the Default key that the API provides or generate a new key with a unique name. Generally, you'd only need multiple keys if you are using the API in multiple locations (such as on different sites) and you want to keep track of the API usage in each location.

- At this point, you'll be able to access a dashboard that includes your API key as well as your remaining API calls for the month.
